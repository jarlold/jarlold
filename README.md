Internet people call me Jarold. I get obsessed with ideas easily and have a drinking problem. Contact me for anything ML or cyber security related, I live for that stuff.
I'm also one of those Linux guys who does everything from the terminal and uses VIM all day. I'll help you with your Linux problems but only if you listen to me 
preach the good word of FOSS.

Contact me if:
- If you have a cool whitepaper you want someone to proof read.
- If you have troubles implementing a paper I was part of.
- If you need another engineer/researcher for a paper.
- If someone used something I made to make you miserable.
- If you just want to hang out, contact me, I live in a small server cabinet devoid of both sun and moon light and have not spoken to another human in many epochs.
